# Copy-Bank
A tool to cenralise prefab text under nicknames.

Made this to replace an old, no longer supported program with similar functionality. You can click on a grid of buttons to change the text values stored by each, or copy it to clipboard.

Place the file in its own folder. Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer. Create a shortcut to the .py file and move it to the desktop, etc.
Also ensure you have these libraries installed on your computer: <tkinter, pyperclip>

To install a library, go to command prompt and type `pip install {the library's name}`, and if Python is already installed it should handle the rest.

The program should handle any other dependencies. Do not tamper with the 'copybank.txt' file as it may cause the data to become corrupt, forcing all stored data to require a wipe.

Thanks!
